### Project Description
A calendar application that allows users to select a year and view its events. The application features a unique "Snap" button that removes the oldest year from the list with a fun animation.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
What if we could get rid of years we no longer need? Why should we keep the past when we can snap it away?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Using the Thanos Snap Calendar, you can simply click a button to remove the oldest year from your view, making it a lighthearted way to manage your calendar!
